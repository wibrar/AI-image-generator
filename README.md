# React Native Text-to-Image Converter

A simple React Native application that converts text input into an image using the Hugging Face API. Users can enter text, click a button, and the application will generate an image representing the entered text.

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-native-text-to-image-converter.git

### expo start

This will start the Expo development server. You can then run the app on an emulator or a physical device using the Expo Go app.

## Usage
1. Enter text in the input field.
2. Press the "Click to generate" button.
